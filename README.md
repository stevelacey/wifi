## Installation

```sh
npm install -g wifi-cli-macos
```

## Basic usage

```sh
wifi ls
Network 1 ▁▂▃▄▅▆
Network 2 ▁▂▃▄▅
Network 3 ▁▂▃
Network 4 ▁▂
Network 5 ▁▂
Network 6 ▁
```

```sh
wifi c "Network 1" changeme
```

```sh
wifi i
Current Wi-Fi Network: Network 1
```

### Configure DNS servers

```sh
wifi dns 8.8.8.8
```

```sh
wifi dns empty
```

### Turn Wi-Fi off and on again

```sh
wifi r
```

## Advanced usage

WiFi CLI MacOS also supplies commands for enabling and disabling [Argo Tunnel (cloudflared)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/)

Argo Tunnel is a Cloudflare tool which (amongst other things) can be used to proxy DNS over SSL:

```sh
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

WiFi CLI MacOS makes enabling/disabling Argo Tunnel a little easier, the
`wifi cf on/off/r` commands start/stop/restart
[the homebrew service](https://github.com/cloudflare/homebrew-cloudflare/pull/3)
and toggle your DNS servers between localhost and network defaults
